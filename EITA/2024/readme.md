# 1. From Flayway presentation for EITA Consuling Client :


Flyway is a database migration tool that helps you manage and version your database schema. It supports a variety of databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server. Flyway is easy to use and can be integrated into your existing development process.

Flyway works by reading a series of SQL migration scripts from a central location. These scripts are typically named with a timestamp or version number, and they are executed in order to bring the database schema up to the desired version. Flyway also keeps track of which migrations have been applied, so that it can safely re-run migrations if necessary.

Flyway is a valuable tool for any database developer who wants to manage their database schema in a controlled and repeatable way. It can help to prevent errors and ensure that your database is always up to date.

Here are some of the benefits of using Flyway:

* Simplifies database migrations: Flyway makes it easy to migrate your database schema from one version to another. You simply need to create a new migration script and Flyway will take care of the rest.
Repeatable migrations: Flyway ensures that migrations are repeatable, even if they are run multiple times. This is important for ensuring that your database is always in a consistent state.
* Safe migrations: Flyway has a number of features that help to prevent errors during migrations. For example, Flyway will never execute a migration that would cause data loss.
* Easy to use: Flyway is easy to use and can be integrated into your existing development process. It is also well-documented and supported by a large community of users.
  
 So, If you are looking for a database migration tool that is simple, repeatable, safe, and easy to use, then Flyway is the perfect tool for you.
